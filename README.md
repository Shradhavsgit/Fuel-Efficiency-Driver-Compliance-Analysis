Fuel Efficiency & Driver Compliance Analysis – EFS Cloud (SQL + Excel Project)
Pulled fuel transaction data from EFS Cloud via JDBC SQL Server to analyze truck mileage and driver fueling behavior.
Identified violations for fueling outside designated gas stations and calculated MPG (miles per gallon) per truck.
Drivers achieving mileage above 7 MPG were marked eligible for fuel bonuses.
Final analysis and reports were automated in Excel for operational tracking.
